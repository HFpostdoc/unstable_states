unstable_states
===============

r values for cycle thresholds:
- 2 cycles: 2
- 4 cycles: 2.45
- 8 cycles: 2.547
- 16 cycles: 2.567

Try audio output?

What theory or math can we use if stable states are the exception?

What would theory look like if we don't start with a concept of stability?

What do dynamics look like in systems without stable states?

Using the logistic difference model of population growth developed by
May (1976), simulate changes in the model parameter (a) at different
locations along the gradient of stationary to chaotic oscillations.

Variables
- inital alpha
- final alpha
- number of alphas
- alpha step size
- generation time
- N vs X

Response
- look at transient dynamics
- look at oscillating dynamics
