unstable_states
===============

What do dynamics look like in systems without stable states?

Using the logistic difference model of population growth developed by
May (1976), simulate changes in the model parameter (a) at different
locations along the gradient of stationary to chaotic oscillations.

Variables
- inital alpha
- final alpha
- number of alphas
- alpha step size
- generation time
- N vs X

Response
- look at transient dynamics
- look at oscillating dynamics
