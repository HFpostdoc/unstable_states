unstable_states
===============

*A brief history of Ecosystem dynamics* 
- phenomenology -> succession -> diversity-stability -> systems theory -> alternative stable states
- Questions:
1. What theory or math can we use if stable states are the exception?
2. What would theory look like if we don't start with a concept of stability?
3. What do dynamics look like in systems without stable states?

*Equilibrium: the Utility of Balance*
- Equilibrium = base model
- Equilibrium = mathematical tractability

*Equilibrium: What's lost in the balance?* 
- Support for equilibrium? 
- Support for non-equilibrium?
- Transience and state variability (Fukami paper)

*Leaving Equilibrium Behind: New Approaches and The Arrow of Time*
- control theory
- complex systems theory
- convergent cross mapping
- introducing dynamics
- evolutionary dynamics (community genetics)
